# iShare
Are you having difficulty sharing files and folders between PCs on the same local network? With iShare it is very simple and safe: just one click!

iShare is compatible with all versions of Windows and can be installed using the appropriate setup.

When started, it automatically detects the presence of connected and accredited users on the platform and ready to receive the desired files.

Through the GUI it is possible to change one's activity status from public to private: in this way the application remains active, but the user will not be announced within the local network.
